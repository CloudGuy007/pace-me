# PaceMe

Welcome to PaceMe. This is a simple app designed to bring runners from all walks of life together to keep running.

## Getting Started

This app is currently only available in the San Francisco Bay Area. Register now and sign up with a zip code in the Bay to start messaging other users in the area. **Disclaimer: until we have a sizable number of users in our database, there will be pre-generated dummy users with questionable data.**


## Guests

Guests may view users in their area up to a default radius of 10 miles but cannot message or visit the profiles of other users until
guests are registered and/or logged in. Type in a zip code (currently SF Bay Area-only zip codes) to start seeing what other Pacers are around!

## Users

Users may edit their own profile and visit the profiles of other users. The logged in user (SENDER) may then send a text message to another user (RECIPIENT)
via PaceMe, which will attach a link to SENDER's profile. Unless SENDER provides own number in the message, RECIPIENT may contact back by visiting
SENDER's profile in the link attached with the message. Users are encouraged to exchange numbers early on in the conversation as PaceMe is designed to get two
or more runners in the area introduced, but they may feel free to keep texting each other through the app if they so desire. :)

Users are encouraged to fill out as much information as possible in their profile to give others a good idea of whom they may be running with next!
